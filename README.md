### Introduction:

A highly motivated data science enthusiast learned Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing through iNeuron.
I have a strong strong understanding of machine learning algorithms and frameworks (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, clustering, deep learning, Neural Networks,RNN,LSTM,Encoder-Decoder, transformers, huggingface, CNN, transfer learning).
Learned ML libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy, and data manipulation and analysis tools like numpy and pandas,data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
Developed hands-on projects, based on text classification, text summarization,Image captioning, and predictive modeling etc. Proficient in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and visualization.
Learned cloud environments like GCP.
Passionate about leveraging AI to solve real-world problems.

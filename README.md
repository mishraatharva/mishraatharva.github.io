### Introduction:

A highly motivated data science enthusiast learned Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing through iNeuron.
I have a strong strong understanding of machine learning algorithms and frameworks (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, clustering, deep learning, Neural Networks,RNN,LSTM,Encoder-Decoder, transformers, huggingface, CNN, transfer learning).
Learned ML libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy, and data manipulation and analysis tools like numpy and pandas,data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
Developed hands-on projects, based on text classification, text summarization,Image captioning, and predictive modeling etc. Proficient in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and visualization.
Learned cloud environments like GCP.
Passionate about leveraging AI to solve real-world problems.

 ### PROJECTS:

**Image Sharing Platform:**
-  Developed an Image Captioning Web Application that generates descriptive captions for uploaded images using deep learning and computer vision.

  #### Key Features:
  - User can signup by providing required data.
  - Login using gmail and password
  - All data in stored in mongodb
  - User will login and upload a picture of his choice and caption for uploaded image can be created automatically.

**Flight Price Prediction:**
- Created a web-based flight price prediction platform, where users can input various parameters
  to obtain a fare prediction for flight.
- Performed full EDA and feature-engineering which involves tools like seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn.
- The project involves developing a user-friendly interface using streamlit for predicting flight fare.Used machine learning models to predict flight prices based on features
- Used multiple machine learning algorithms and achieved 0.79 and 0.76 in XGBRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor respectively.
